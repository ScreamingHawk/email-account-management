# Email Account Management

> A set of endpoints to manage email subscriptions without passwords

## Goal

This project allows users to manage an *account* or *subscription* via an email address.

Leverages the [serverless][0] framework to use [AWS Lambda][1] for server less architecture and [AWS S3][2] for cheap persisted storage.
